# .NET Cheat Sheet
A quick cheat sheet for all commonly used .NET Apis.

For each method or property, it provides one MD file with all the information you need to use it:
- Simple description
- Examples
- Edge cases

They can be looked up right inside Visual Studio using the Cheat Visual Studio extension when using each method.

## Structure
Each method, property or event, should be created as a .MD file with the following exact path:
{Namespace}/{Class}/{Member}.md

For example the Append() method of the StringBuilder class will be documented here:
> System/Text/StringBuilder/Append.md
